# Quick Setup Guide

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd nomadway
npm install
```

### 2. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the Expo development server and show a QR code.

### 3. (Optional) Start the AI Chat Backend Server

For AI Chat functionality, you need to run the backend server:

```bash
cd server
npm install
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your OpenAI API key
npm start
```

See `AI_CHAT_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.

### 4. Run on Your Device

**Option A: Using Expo Go App**
1. Install "Expo Go" from App Store (iOS) or Google Play (Android)
2. Scan the QR code shown in the terminal
3. The app will load on your device

**Option B: Using Emulator/Simulator**
- **iOS**: `npm run ios` (requires Xcode on Mac)
- **Android**: `npm run android` (requires Android Studio)
- **Web**: `npm run web`

## ⚠️ Notes

- Images are loaded from Unsplash (requires internet connection)
- Maps require internet for initial load (then cached)
- All data is stored locally (no backend needed for core features)
- Saved places persist using AsyncStorage
- **AI Chat requires backend server** - See `AI_CHAT_SETUP.md` for setup
- Map defaults to Kazakhstan view (48.0196, 66.9237) with zoom level 5

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Issue: Maps not showing**
- Ensure you have internet connection for initial map load
- On iOS, you may need to configure location permissions in `app.json`

**Issue: Images not loading**
- Check internet connection (images load from Unsplash)
- Images will show placeholder if offline

**Issue: Navigation not working**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Clear cache: `npm start -- --clear`

Happy coding! 🎉
